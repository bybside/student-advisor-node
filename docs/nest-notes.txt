Recommended Project Structure:
- src/ contains main.ts and app.module.ts at level 0
- contains sub-level directory for every feature module (e.g. src/<feature_module_name>/)
- feature module directories contain files with the following naming convention:
  - <feature_name>.<component_type>.ts (e.g. user.controller.ts)

Creating Console Apps:
- Nest can be used to create console apps that take advantage of all of its IoC (DI) and modularity features and more
  - in main.ts:
    - const app = await NestFactory.createApplicationContext(<root_app_module_name>)
      <application logic here>
      await app.close()
